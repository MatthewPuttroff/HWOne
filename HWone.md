# Case Study Proposal
# Fidelity Digital Assets 

## Who is Fidelity Investments?

Fidelity Investments, Inc., known colloquially as "Fidelity", is an American multinational financial services corporation based in Boston, MA. Established in 1946 as Fidelity Management & Research (FMR) by Edward C. Johnson II, Fidelity is, as of June 2020, the third largest asset management concern in the world with $4.9 trillion in assets under management (AUM), behind only BlackRock and Vanguard.

## What is Fidelity Digital Assets?

Fidelity Digital Assets is a fledgling platform being developed by Fidelity Investments which is being designed to provide cryptocurrency custody and trade execution for Fidelity's institutional investors. Announced in October 2018, Fidelity Digital Assets will provide a business-grade offline cold storage solution for cryptoassets.

## Why is this interesting?

The cryptocurrency space is typically thought of as being the domain for startups and ambitious projects. The suprise is notable when people learn that well-established firms that have existed for over 70 years are also dipping their toes into the cryptocurrency waters. In fact, the financial services giant began bitcoin mining back when bitcoin was trading around $180, and Fidelity has a partnership with Coinbase that allows Fidelity customers to check their cryptocurrency balances on the Fidelity app. Fidelity even began facilitating charitable donations in bitcoin back in 2015!

## Is this a good thing, or a bad thing?

This case study will discuss the current cryptocurrency landscape, and explore the benefits and risks of well-capitalized, large firms entering in and competing in the cryptocurrency marketplace.

The topics that will be discussed are:

1. Does having big firms enter the marketplace give creedance and legitimacy to crypto?
2. Does the capital that firms like Fidelity have access to provide advantages that would limit the collective value that would otherwise be realized among the entire crypto community?
3. Do firms like Fidelity attract attention from Government regulators, and would such attention be desirable?

## Notable parameters for this case study

* Fidelity isn't at this time offering a proprietary trading platform for their retail customers. So far, their platform is available only to provide cryptocurrency custody and execution services for their institutional clients
